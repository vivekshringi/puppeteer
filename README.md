Currently the aim of this project is to evaluate the puppeteer as a browser automation tool and provide examples to use its functions. Also it facilitates a automation framework to help testers automating their web applications.

The projects is using _typescript_ and _jest_ to run all example tests.

## Functions 

Following functions are used in this project.

## User defined functions

The plan is to create user defined functions as well. Like for example after performing click, user normally naviagates to new page. so building a function _clickAndNavigate()_ makes more sense.
